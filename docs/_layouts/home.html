        <p><strong>arcologies</strong> is an interactive environment for designing 2d sound arcologies with <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid">monome grid</a> and <a href="https://ableton.com/live">Ableton Live</a>. It works like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrange <strong>cells</strong> on a <strong>field</strong>.</li>
            <li>Change a cell's <strong>structure</strong> to define behavior.</li>
            <li>Open a cell's <strong>ports</strong> to create <strong>leylines</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Signals</strong> strongerge from <strong>hive</strong> cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Signals</strong> play a cell's <strong>note</strong> when the two collide.</li>
            <li>Finally, depending on how the colliding cell is configured, the signal could be re-routed, split, or destroyed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is an M4L midi instrument that pairs especially well with drum racks and <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/instrument-drum-and-effect-racks/#18-5-2-key-zones">zoned instrument racks</a>.</p>

        <p>Add the device to a new midi track and add any instrument to the track. Synths are an easy way to always get some sounds going fast. Drum racks require more configuration to line up all the notes. The most advanced usage probably involves zoned intrument racks. See the demo set included in the download for examples.</p>

    <p>Cells are the building blocks of <strong>arcologies</strong>. In addition to their <code>x</code> / <code>y</code> coordinates, cells have four key components:</p>
    <ol>

    <h3 id="route">Ports</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Ports direct the flow of signals. Each cell has four ports: north, east, south, west. Open ports allow signals in. Closed ports stop signals.</p>
    <p class="alert alert-primary"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Note you can only view/edit the route of one cell at a time.</p>
    <h4>Ports & Metabolism</h4>
    <p>Hives emit signals from <em>all open</em> ports at a rate as defined by their metabolism.</p>
    <p>Gates block signals at a rate defined by their metabolism. A gate with a metabolism of "1" would let every signal through. A gate with a metabolism of "2" would let every second signal through, and so on. Blocked signals are destroyed.</p>
    <p>Shrines work like gates except that instead of blocking signals, they retain signals. So a shrine with a metabolism of "1" would let every signal through with no delay. But with a metabolism of "2", it would hold onto each incoming signal for two beats.</p>
    <h4>Ports & Signal Flow</h4>
    <p>Gates and shrines route incoming signals to <em>every other</em> open port.</p>

    <p>Signals have a position (<code>x</code> & <code>y</code>) and a direction (<code>n</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>s</code>, or <code>w</code>).
    <p>If a signal collides into the side of a cell without an open route, the signal disappears into silence (the poor little signal just smashed into a wall.) The same is true if it wanders off the field. The same is true if they collide with a hive. If a channel disappears from beneath a signal, the signal will continue along.

        <h4>Beat 1 (downbeat)</h4>
        <p>First, the hive will emit three signals: one each to the north, east, and south. The hive will send one midi note (C4) to Live. We'll see the three signals begin traveling each of channels. (Note you cannot view both channels and signal flow at the same time... yet.)</p>
        <h4>Beat 2</h4>
        <p>Signals always move at a rate of 1 cell per quarter note, so on beat 2, the northern signal will collide with the port. It will send midi note F4 to Live. Since this is a dead-end port, the signal is destroyed.</p>
        <h4>Beat 3</h4>
        <p>The eastern and southern signals will continue down their channels.</p>
        <h4>Beat 4</h4>
        <p>The southern signal will collide with the port. It will send midi note F4 to Live. Again, since this is a dead-end port, the signal is destroyed.</p>
        <h4>Beat 5</h4>
        <p>The eastern signal will collide with the port, with the same results as the previous two signals... but it is also time for the hive to emit another cluster of signals! The result is three new singals entering the field from the hive, one leaving at the eastern port, and the dyad of C4 (via hive) & F5 (via eastern port) being sent to Live.</p>

    <p><strong>arcologies</strong> is an instrument for exploration and discovery. At its core it is designed to be a deterministic compositional tool. Mastery of any medium depends on both familiarity and consistent response. This philosophy extends through all the code of <strong>arcologies</strong>. If a certain combination of events occur, the context that gave rise to their emergence ought to be reproducible with 100% accuracy. With a given configuration of cells, structures, notes, (and eventually nomads), entire songs could emerge <em>and be replayed note-for-note</em> from a relatively simple set of rules.</p>
