        <p>Add the device to a new midi track and add any instrument to the track. Synths are an easy way to always get some sounds going fast. Drum racks require more configuration to line up all the notes. The most advanced usage probably involves zoned intrument racks. See the demo set included in the download for examples.</p>

    <h3 id="ports">Ports</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Ports direct the flow of signals. Each cell has four ports: north, east, south, west. Open ports allow signals in. Closed ports stop signals. Select a cell, then press adjacent keys to toggle ports on and off.</p>
    <p>Hives emit signals from <em>all open</em> ports at a rate as defined by their metabolism. The default metabolism is 4. This means every fourth generation (or "beat") signals will be emitted.</p>
    <p>Gates and shrines route incoming signals to <em>every other</em> open port. So if a gate or shrine only has one port open, any signal that enters will be destroyed. If a gate or shrine has two ports open, the signal will emerge from the other port. If a gate or shrine has three ports open, the signal will be split in two and emerge from the other two ports. Finally, if all four ports are open, the signal will emerge from all three other ports.</p>

    <h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Signals are born from hives, routed and split by both gates and shrines, and play notes at shrines.</p>
    <p>Signals have a position (<code>x</code> & <code>y</code>) and a direction (<code>n</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>s</code>, or <code>w</code>).
    <p>If a signal collides into a closed port, the signal disappears into silence (the poor little signal just smashed into a wall.) The same is true if it wanders off the field. The same is true if they collide with a hive. If a leyline disappears from beneath a signal, the signal will continue along. Perhaps you can help it will find its way again?</p>
    <p>If two (or more) signals land at the same place at the same time -- either in the field or at a cell -- both will be destroyed. However, signals may "pass" through each other so long as they wouldn't land at the same cell on the same beat.</p>

    <p><strong>arcologies</strong> is an instrument for exploration and discovery. At its core it is designed to be a deterministic compositional tool. Mastery of any medium depends on both familiarity and consistent response. This philosophy extends through all the code of <strong>arcologies</strong>. If a certain combination of events occur, the context that gave rise to their emergence ought to be reproducible with 100% accuracy. With a given configuration of cells, structures, and metabolisms, entire songs can emerge <em>and be replayed note-for-note</em> from a relatively simple set of rules.</p>
